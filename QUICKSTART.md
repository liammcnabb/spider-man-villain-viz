# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Get Your Spider-Man Villain Timeline Running in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Open Terminal
```bash
cd c:\Users\Dingle\Documents\spider-man-villain-timeline
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (2-3 minutes)
```bash
npm install
```

**What this does:**
- Installs axios (HTTP client)
- Installs cheerio (HTML parser)
- Installs d3 (visualization library)
- Installs TypeScript and development tools

### Step 3: Scrape Marvel Fandom Data (30-40 seconds)
```bash
npm run scrape
```

**What this does:**
- Connects to https://marvel.fandom.com
- Fetches Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 issues 1-20
- Extracts antagonist information
- Normalizes villain names
- Calculates statistics
- Saves to `data/villains.json`
- Saves visualization config to `data/d3-config.json`

**Expected output:**
```
🕷️  Starting Marvel Fandom scraper...
Scraping issue 1...
Scraping issue 2...
[... 18 more issues ...]
✓ Scraped 20 issues
Processing data...
✓ Saved to data/villains.json
✓ Saved D3 config to data/d3-config.json

📊 Statistics:
   Total Villains: XX
   Most Frequent: [Villain Name] (XX appearances)
   Average Frequency: X.XX

✅ Scraping complete!
```

### Step 4: Start the Web Server (10 seconds)
```bash
npm run serve
```

**Output:**
```
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser
Visit: **http://localhost:8000**

You should see:
- 📊 Statistics panel (total villains, most frequent, etc.)
- 📈 Interactive timeline chart
- 🦹 Searchable villain index
- 📱 Responsive design

## 📚 What Each File Does

### Main Application Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/index.ts` | Entry point - runs the scraper |
| `src/scraper/marvelScraper.ts` | Fetches data from Marvel Fandom |
| `src/utils/dataProcessor.ts` | Cleans and organizes the data |
| `src/visualization/d3Graph.ts` | Prepares data for visualization |
| `public/script.js` | Makes the D3 chart interactive |

### Generated Files (after scraping)
| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `data/villains.json` | All villain data (processed) |
| `data/d3-config.json` | Visualization configuration |

---

## 🔧 Other Useful Commands

### Build TypeScript to JavaScript
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates `dist/` folder with compiled JavaScript.

### Run Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```
Same as `npm run scrape` but with faster compilation.

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```
(Tests not yet created - you can add them!)

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Command not found: npm
**Solution:** Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### npm install fails
```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -r node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Scraper can't connect to Marvel Fandom
- Check your internet connection
- Check if marvel.fandom.com is accessible
- Try again (might be temporary)

### Visualization not loading
- Did `npm run scrape` complete without errors?
- Does `data/villains.json` exist?
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Try clearing cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

### Port 8000 already in use
```bash
# Use a different port
python -m http.server 8080 --directory public
# Then visit http://localhost:8080
```
