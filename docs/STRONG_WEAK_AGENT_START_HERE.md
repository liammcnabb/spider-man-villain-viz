# Strong → Weak Agent Workflow: Start Here

**A Context Engineering pattern for fully-automated, reproducible issue resolution**

---

## 🎯 What This Is

A workflow where:
1. **Strong Agent** investigates an issue, proves it's real, and creates exact task instructions
2. **Weak Agents** (code, tests, docs) execute those instructions sequentially
3. **Everything is automated** - no manual coordination needed
4. **Everything is verifiable** - proof at every step

**Result:** Complex issues fixed reliably, with full documentation trail.

## 🎬 Quick Example

```
User: "The villain timeline shows Green Goblin 3 times instead of 1"

Strong Agent:
  ✓ Finds bug in mergeSeries.ts
  ✓ Writes test showing 3 instead of 1
  ✓ Creates 3 task instructions
  → delegates automatically

Task A (Code Agent):
  ✓ Modifies mergeSeries.ts lines 92-95
  ✓ Runs npm build
  ✓ Verifies public/script.js contains fix

Task B (Test Agent):
  ✓ Writes test: "should deduplicate villains"
  ✓ Runs npm test
  ✓ All tests pass

Task C (Docs Agent):
  ✓ Updates docs/API.md
  ✓ Verifies links work
  ✓ Examples match code

Result:
  ✅ Bug fixed
  ✅ Tests added
  ✅ Documented
  ✅ Fully verified
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Strong Agent Responsibility
- **Diagnose** the issue completely
- **Prove** it's real (with tests)
- **Plan** the fix (exact steps)
- **Delegate** to weak agents

### Weak Agent Responsibility
- **Execute** exact instructions
- **Verify** each step works
- **Report** results honestly
- **Never improvise**

### Verification at Every Stage
- Prove issue exists (tests)
- Verify code changes (check compiled output)
- Verify tests pass (npm test)
- Verify docs are correct (check links)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Understand (Read One of These)
- ⏱️ 5 min: QUICK_REFERENCE_STRONG_WEAK_WORKFLOW.md
- ⏱️ 30 min: STRONG_WEAK_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md  
- ⏱️ 1 hour: All four documents

### Step 2: See It Work

- Follow Weak Agent steps

### Step 3: Implement
- Study SEQUENTIAL_SUBAGENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Adapt code for your project
- Integrate runSubagent() calls
- Test with real issues

### Step 4: Iterate
- Run 10+ workflows
- Find optimization opportunities
- Measure execution time
- Document your patterns

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Is this only for bug fixes?**
A: No, works for features, refactoring, documentation, testing - any multi-step task.

**Q: How long does a workflow take?**
A: ~15-20 minutes for a complex issue (diagnosis + 3 tasks sequential).

**Q: Can I parallelize?**
A: Yes - manually now (3× faster), or build a tool later (fully automated parallel).

**Q: Do I have to do all 3 tasks?**
A: No, skip tasks you don't need (e.g., no docs update? Skip task C).

**Q: What if something fails?**
A: Weak Agent reports failure, Strong Agent diagnoses why, retry with updated instructions.
